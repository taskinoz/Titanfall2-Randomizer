# Titanfall2 Randomizer
A mod to randomize Weapons, Grenades, Abilities, and Helmet Collectables

## About

The Titanfall 2 Randomizer takes the main campaign gameplay and turns it on its head. All the guns are random, all the abilities are random, the Titan classes available are random, and the helmet collectables are random. Each level has 15-30 random positions totalling 170 random positions.

## Install

To use this mod you will need to get [Icepick](https://titanfallmods.com/), which is a mod loader for Titanfall 2.

After getting Icepick download the [Titanfall 2 Randomizer](https://github.com/taskinoz/Titanfall-Randomizer-Hints/releases) and drag the zip file onto the Icepick launcher. For optimal compatibility disable all the other mods by double clicking on them.

You can now launch the game with the Icepick launcher.
